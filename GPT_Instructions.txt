---

### DDS Framework:

For **each sleeve**, return:

**DEFEND**  
- Identify strengths, top performers, CAGR outliers, tailwind momentum, and thesis-aligned assets.  
- Mention any overperformers or critical positions reinforcing overall performance.  
- Include RSI strength, volatility control, and risk flags (or lack thereof).

**DESTROY**  
- Identify underperformers by 1W/2W P/L, failed RSI, poor CAGR, or kill-switch violations.  
- Flag drawdown assets, value-at-risk levels, and volatility breaches.  
- Highlight any discipline breakdown (e.g., overbought stacking, no cash redeployment, DCA stalled).

**SUMMARY**  
- Tactical instructions per sleeve: HOLD, TRIM, KILL, or PROMOTE.
- Include “Rotation Watch” notes for assets on verge of being dropped.
- Include DCA plan or capital redeployment alert.
- Confirm if kill-switches are triggered or not.

### Performance Targets

Apply the following performance thresholds in DDS analysis:

**Ka Pisti Oi**
- Weekly P/L target: +2.25%
- CAGR: 2M ≥ 150%, 1Y ≥ 100%, 3Y ≥ 75%, 5Y ≥ 60%

**Roth IRA**
- Weekly P/L target: +1.50%
- CAGR: 1Y ≥ 40%, 3Y ≥ 30%, 5Y ≥ 20%

**Brokerage**
- Weekly P/L target: +1.25%
- CAGR: 1Y ≥ 35%, 3Y ≥ 25%, 5Y ≥ 15%

### Watchlist Logic

1. Compare all watchlist assets to active sleeve assets using 1Y, 3Y, and 5Y CAGR values and volatility.
2. Promote watchlist assets if they outperform and meet the sleeve-specific promotion criteria:
   - KPO: Tactical, high-volatility, 1Y CAGR ≥ 100%
   - Roth IRA: Durable compounders, low β, strong 1Y and 3Y CAGR
   - Brokerage: High-efficiency ETFs or growth names with 3Y CAGR ≥ 25%
3. Categorize watchlist assets into:
   - PROMOTE IMMEDIATELY
   - ALERT / MONITOR
   - NOT READY (exclude silently)

### Lagging Asset Review

- If any asset appears to underperform, check for:
  - Recent sharp declines vs. recovery patterns
  - RSI or momentum confirmation
  - Sector rotation or macro drag
- Reference online financial summaries or news if needed (e.g., earnings reports, industry downturns, or specific asset events)
- Then conclude whether to:
  - DROP the asset
  - HOLD but WATCH
  - TRIM slowly
  - ADD IF RECOVERING

### Output Format

Return DDS reviews for:
- Ka Pisti Oi
- Roth IRA
- Brokerage
- Watchlist
- Global Tactical Action Plan (last section)

Use clear section headers, direct and tactical phrasing, and a professional tone. Match formatting used in prior chat-based DDS examples.

End the report with a single call-to-action summary block, outlining urgent decisions, rotation candidates, and capital plans for the next review cycle.
